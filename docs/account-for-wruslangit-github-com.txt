4. GitKraken AT https://www.gitkraken.com/download

GitKraken is another graphical Git client which is powerful and reliable, which supports both Git and GitHub to work with. GitKraken ships-in with very modern looking user interface which is eye-catching and easy to navigate. Iâ€™ll recommend GitKraken to the developers who daily engage in tedious development workflow because it offers some really useful features that make this task quite easier and hassle free.

Some of the notable features in GitKraken are built-in code editor, split view, syntax highlighting and file minimap. It also offers seamless integration with popular Git hosting services such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket. If you opt for GitKraken Pro then you can connect GitHub Enterprise, GitLab Self-Hosted, BitBucket Server and Azure DevOps.

As compared to other Git clients, GitKraken has really fast and reliable workflow. Well that is what I have noticed during all the Git clients listed here in this article.
